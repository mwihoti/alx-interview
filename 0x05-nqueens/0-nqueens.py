"""
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking
queens on an N×N chessboard.
Write a program that solves the N queens problem.
Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage:
nqueens N,followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
and exit with thestatus 1 . If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4,
followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
One solution per line
Format: see example
You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
You are only allowed to import the sys module
